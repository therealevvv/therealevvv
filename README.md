# You probably found this from discord!
I'll most likley update this github with stuff from my old github but for now its really just a more private github I can publically share.
## My level in coding languages
- **Javascript** I have memorized the entire language. Mainly used for the minecraft mod JsMacros or when I feel like coding a website from scratch.
- **Python** Best language I complete all my leet code problems in this language.
- **Java** I got a 4 on my AP java test in 9th grade, I only code in this language for minecraft and when I need to practice.
- **Lua** OG its where I started coding, used it in roblox studio a lot. Im proficient in it.
- **Anyhing else** Excluding basic languages like html or css, I'm probably not that good at it.

Alright so I've ran out of ideas to add here. Might add some cool star things or counters on how much time I spend coding in a specific language, but thats a pain so I probably wont.
